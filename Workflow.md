## A typical work day for a developer. 

* A typical work day at CrownStack lasts from 10 AM in the morning to 7 PM in evening. We believe this time is sufficient to meet all deadlines. We also believe that over time is a serious management failure.

### Zero Hour 
* Very first hour in the day (10 AM - 11 AM) is `Zero Hour` where you learn something new, every single day. This one hour is given to everybody so that they can use it for `One month Level up Challenge`. To know more about `One month Level up Challenge`, please scroll down.
* The zero hour is basically a learning hour, we recommend no office work should be done during this time. It should be utilised to upgrade your skills. 
* You can also read tech news, read your favourite blogs, browse twitter for tech news and watch tech videos. 

### Planning Hour.
* This generally lasts from 11 AM - 12 PM. The idea is that you should have a working plan ready for the day.
* Please check that no one is blocked by you. If you need to review someone's pull request please do that first. If someone needs your assistance please provide first thing in the morning. 
* If you need to fix code review comments, please finish during this time.
* Please check email for any unexpected task you have been assigned. 
* If you need to discuss something with other person or schedule a meeting with someone else, this is time slot. 
* If you think you do not have work for the day, Please contact your buddy.
* **We also recommend that your first 30 minutes should be used to refactor your code. You can cover that too in planning hour.***
* By 12:00 PM we assume everyone has sorted out the problem and they have day's plan ready for them.
* If you not filled yesterday's time sheet please submit that during this hour.

### Working hours.

* Continue with the sprint plan in the day or the plan you made during planning hour.
* Absolutely no meetings are allowed on Tuesday and Thursday.
* There should be no meetings in working hours except progress reviews and emergencies. 
* Make sure you minimise meeting and other disturbances during a day. Monday, Wednesday and Friday are sprint progress review days.
* Please create pull request before going home and assign a reviewer.
* Please do not forget to fill timesheet for the day.

### Super Hour (Tech Talk).

* Every month, one employee will be asked to give a tech talk lasting 30 to 60 minutes. Employees can volunteer too. The aim of tech talk is to share your skill with every team member. For example, if you know few tricks on git and GitHub you can share with all team members.  Sharing tricks of your IDE and best practices you use can be another example.

### Admin Hour (Monthly)

* Every last working hour of a month is called Admin Hour where are Admin related works will be finished. For example collecting documents, transferring salaries and other admin related works can be finished here. 

### Buddy

* Every developer will be paired with a senior developer called Buddy. The Buddy will help a junior developer to grow and be better at his work. After a period of 3 months pair will be changed and a new buddy will be assigned. Also, after 3 months rotation, both Buddy and junior developer will give a review to each other where Buddy's ability to guide and developer's ability to learn will be judged. This will also be counted in performance review later.

If you do not know who is your Buddy, Please contact Aashish Dhawan

## A typical Sprint 

* A sprint lasts two weeks. 
* First day (or maximum first two days), please make sure your sprint plan is ready and you can work without being blocked by someone for a full sprint. Please ensure you will have minimum blockages, disturbances and meetings during next 15 days.
* Monday, Wednesday and Friday are sprint progress review days.
* Sprint retrospective are part of last sprint day's meetings. 
* Builds are delivered every Monday, Wednesday and Friday whether someone asks or not. 


## One month Level up Challenge. 

* Every team member is given a new thing to learn every single month to improve their skill set. 
* Everyone is also given `Zero Hour` daily to spend on their learning which is basically the first hour in the day.
* Everyone is expected to write a [blog](https://crownstack.github.io) on the topic which they learned in last month. 
* After every month employee performance, contribution to open source, increase in skill level, work done will be reviewed which will form the basis of annual performance review.
