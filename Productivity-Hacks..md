## 3 Minute Rule. 

If you think you came across a task which can be done within 3 minutes, Do at once and never ever postpone these kinds of tasks. For example, you have read an email which needs a reply, do reply immediately. Need to submit an online form? Do it, now. 

## Boy Scout Rule.

Always leave compound better than you found. 
For example, did you fix a bug in a code? Well...make sure to refactor it a little bit if there is a need. Are you reading code written by someone else and you think you can make it little better? Do it. 

## Home is not the second office.

Please try not to take office work home. Work efficiently in office to finish your daily work within office hours. Go home, enjoy with family and friends. Exercise a bit. Live a life.

## Delive a programming product, not a program.
